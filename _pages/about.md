Masters student in **Robotics, Systems and Control (RSC)** at **ETH Z端rich**. I am passionate about achieving **physical robotic intelligence** through novel learning paradigms and real-world interaction, especially in contact-rich tasks involving dexterous manipulation. 

Currently, I am working on data-driven differentiable simulation for learning quadrotor control, supervised by [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html) in the **Robotics and Perception Group**, University of Z端rich.

During my undergrad at **The University of Melbourne**, Australia, I worked on adaptive autonomy in human-robot shared control and teleoperation with [Dr. Jonathan Eden](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/453579-jonathan-eden), [Prof. Wafa Johal](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/892823-wafa-johal-benkaouar-johal) and [Prof. Denny Oetomo](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/188333-denny-oetomo). I also worked on grasp and trajectory optimization for robotic arms with [Dr. Akansel Cosgun](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/akanselcosgun) and [Dr. James Saunderson](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/jamessaunderson) at **Monash University**.

Feel free to email me ([jiapan@student.ethz.ch](mailto:jiapan@student.ethz.ch)) for **research collaborations**.
