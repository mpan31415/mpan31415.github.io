I am a visiting researcher at [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) working on dexterous robot manipulation, under the supervision of [Prof. Jitendra Malik](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/). I am also a final-year Master's student in Robotics at ETH Zürich, advised by [Prof. Stelian Coros](https://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html).

Previously, I worked on rapid real-world policy learning using differentiable simulation, under the supervision of [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html). Prior to that, I worked on haptic and AR-augmented teleoperation interfaces for adaptive human-robot shared control.

My current research interests revolve around designing novel **robot learning** frameworks through **efficient real-world interaction** to achieve agile and adaptive behaviors in complex and dynamic real-world environments.

**I am currently seeking PhD positions starting Fall 2026!**
