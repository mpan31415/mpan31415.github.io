I am a visiting researcher at [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) working on dexterous robot manipulation, supervised by [Prof. Jitendra Malik](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/) (UC Berkeley, Meta) and co-supervised by [Prof. Stelian Coros](https://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html) (ETH Zürich). 

I am also a Master's student in Robotics at ETH Zürich. Previously, I worked on a novel framework for rapid, real-world policy adaptation unifying online residual dynamics learning with differentiable simulation, supervised by [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html) in the Robotics and Perception Group, University of Zürich. I have previously also worked on haptic and AR-assisted teleoperation interfaces for adaptive human-robot shared control, and a unified grasp and trajectory optimization framework for robotic arms.

My current research interests revolve around designing novel **robot learning** paradigms through **efficient real-world interaction**.

Feel free to email me ([jiapan@student.ethz.ch](mailto:jiapan@student.ethz.ch)) for research collaborations.
