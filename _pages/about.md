Masters student in **Robotics, Systems and Control (RSC)** at **ETH Zürich**. I am passionate about achieving **physical robotic intelligence** through novel learning paradigms and real-world interaction.

I am currently a visiting student researcher at [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) (BAIR, UC Berkeley) supervised by [Prof. Jitendra Malik](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/), working on my Master's thesis in dexterous robot manipulation and agile whole-body control. I am also fortunate to be co-supervised by [Prof. Stelian Coros](https://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html) of the [Computational Robotics Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch/index.html), ETH Zürich. Prior to this, I worked on data-driven differentiable simulation for adaptive learning-based quadrotor control, supervised by [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html) in the Robotics and Perception Group, University of Zürich.

I completed my undergraduate studies at The University of Melbourne, Australia, where I worked on adaptive autonomy in human-robot shared control and teleoperation with [Dr. Jonathan Eden](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/453579-jonathan-eden), [Prof. Wafa Johal](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/892823-wafa-johal-benkaouar-johal) and [Prof. Denny Oetomo](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/188333-denny-oetomo). I also worked on grasp and trajectory optimization for robotic arms with [Dr. Akansel Cosgun](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/akanselcosgun) and [Dr. James Saunderson](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/jamessaunderson) at Monash University.
