I am a visiting researcher at [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) working on dexterous robot manipulation, under the supervision of [Prof. Jitendra Malik](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/). I am also a Master's student in Robotics at ETH Zürich, with [Prof. Stelian Coros](https://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html) as my thesis advisor. 

Previously, I worked on rapid real-world policy adaptation using differentiable simulation, under the supervision of [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html). Prior to that, I worked on haptic and AR-assisted teleoperation interfaces for adaptive human-robot shared control in the [Computational HRI Lab](https://chri-lab.github.io/) and [Human Robotics Lab](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/human-robotics/) at the University of Melbourne.

My current research interests revolve around designing novel **robot learning** paradigms through **efficient real-world interaction**.

Feel free to email me ([jiapan@student.ethz.ch](mailto:jiapan@student.ethz.ch)) for research collaborations.
