I am a visiting researcher at [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) working on **dexterous robot manipulation**, under the supervision of Prof. [Jitendra Malik](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/). I am also a final-year Master's student in Robotics at [ETH Zürich](https://www.iris.ethz.ch/), advised by Prof. [Stelian Coros](https://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html).

Previously, I worked on rapid, **online real-world policy learning** using differentiable simulation, under the supervision of Prof. [Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html). Prior to that, I worked on **haptic and AR-enhanced robot teleoperation** for adaptive human-robot shared control.

My research interests revolve around designing novel **robot learning** frameworks to achieve **agile, adaptive, and dexterous** behaviors in complex and dynamic real-world environments.

**I am currently seeking PhD positions starting Fall 2026!**
